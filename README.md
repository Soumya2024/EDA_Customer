# EDA_Customer
## This project aims to analyze the shopping behavior of customers in various retail store using machine learning techniques.

## The primary objective of this project is to identify the factors that influence customer shopping behavior and predict their future purchases. The project will involve data exploration, visualization, and analysis, followed by the application of unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms, including K-Means Clustering, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Neural Networks. Finally evaluation of the results of these models.

## Important Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

## Data Exploration: We are dealing with huge data and initially analysing the features and relation of the features with each other. Also using graphs of numerical and categorical features. It is a way to get to know data before working with it. Through survey and investigation, large datasets are readied for deeper, more structured analysis.

## Data Visualization: It’s a significant aspect of analysing data. Data visualization provides a good, organized pictorial representation of the data which makes it easier to understand, observe, analyze. Python provides multiple libraries for visualization. Here we are using Matplotlib which is an easy-to-use, low-level data visualization library that is built on NumPy arrays.

## Standard Scaler: We applied StandardScaler to resize the distribution of values ​​so that the mean of the observed values ​​is 0 and the standard deviation is 1.

## PCA(Principal Component Analysis): The Principal Component Analysis is a popular unsupervised learning technique for reducing the dimensionality of data. We have used it to find the most significant features for training and testing of our model for optimum result.

## Unsupervised learning through K-Means Clustering: K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm. We drew the graph of WCSS vs No. of clusters, known as Elbow method.

## Supervised Learning- Regression: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest. Also evaluated the performance through MSE and R-squared.

## Supervised Learning – Classification:  Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest. Also evaluated the performance through Accuracy score.
